class BaseXConverter(object):
    '''
    Converts positive, base-10 numbers to base-X numbers using a custom alphabet.
    The base is given by the length of the alphabet specified in the constructor.
    The first character in the alphabet has a value of zero,
    the second character a value of one, and so forth.

    Examples:
        Base2:  BaseXConverter('01')
        Base2:  BaseXConverter('<>')     # custom alphabet: < is a zero value and > is a one value
        Base4:  BaseXConverter('0123')
        Base20: BaseXConverter('0123456789abcdefghij')

    See the unit tests at the bottom of the file for many examples.
